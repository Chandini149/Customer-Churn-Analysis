# 🏦 Banking Customer Churn Analysis: A Data-Driven Exploration

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns in the banking sector using computational statistics and machine learning techniques. By examining a dataset of 10,000 bank customers, we aim to understand why customers leave and predict potential future churners.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Identify primary drivers of customer churn
- Develop predictive models for early churn detection
- Provide data-driven insights for customer retention strategies

## 🔍 Dataset Features
- Customer demographics
- Banking behavior
- Financial metrics
- Service usage patterns
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Complaint records

## 🛠️ Methods & Technologies
- **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Statistical Testing:**
  - Chi-square tests
  - t-tests
- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - K-Fold Cross-validation

## 📈 Key Findings
- 20.4% overall churn rate in the dataset
- Significant factors affecting churn:
  - 👥 Geographic location
  - 📅 Age of customers
  - 💳 Product engagement
  - ⭐ Customer satisfaction levels
  - 📝 Complaint history
  - 💰 Account balance

## 📊 Model Performance
